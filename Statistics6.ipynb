    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related events. Bayes's theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (E) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n",

    "\n",
    "To illustrate Bayes's theorem, consider the example of a medical test for a rare disease. Suppose the disease affects 1% of the population, and the test has an accuracy of 95%, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of people who have the disease and 5% of people who do not have the disease test positive by mistake.\n",
